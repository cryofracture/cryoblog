# CryoBlog

A django-powered micro blog for me to talk about projects I've worked on and other stuff. I don't tweet, I CryoBlog. (excuse the bad joke).

# Future improvements:

    Over time, I would implement the following changes/upgrades:
        More functional template structure to extend bootstrap functionality to all pages, and make it look prettier.
        Add github API functionality to show cards of my repositories.
        Make the about page a more functional resume page.
